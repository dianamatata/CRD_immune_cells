METHOD1
In 01 we create subfiles of the correlation peaks per cell type, and save them as Rdata files

In 02, we write bash commands from Rscript
You can call bash from R with system
Ex: system("touch /home/users/a/avalosma/IMMUNE_CELLS/diana_scripts/A_CRDs/compared_corr/bash_commands.sh")
Tried to append progressively the bash commands with

cat(Bash_cmd,file =paste0(path_script,"/bash_commands.sh"),append=TRUE)    
cat("\n",file =paste0(path_script,"/bash_commands.sh"),append=TRUE)

In 03, merge all subsections
